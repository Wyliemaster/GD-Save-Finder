# GD Save Finder

A quick python script to fetch your Geometry Dash save data from a server of your choice

# Requirements

- Python 3 (i've only tested on 3.9)

- A Geometry Dash account with a backed up save

# Usage

**config.ini** contains essential data in order to successfully use this program.

- server -> The target server you want to fetch your save from. By default it is the Geometry Dash Data Server however, it can be used for GDPS's if you type `http://<target server>/database`

- username -> this field is for your username on the target server

- password -> this field is for your password on the target server

After setting up config.ini, you can either run the python script in the command prompt using `python3 <current directory>/save_finder.py` or by executing the `run.bat` file provided

# Notes

- This tool is for ***Geometry Dash 2.1***
